    "The algorithm is correct if it terminates by printing, for each test case, whether it is feasible to find a lexicographically smallest path that collects all packages, given a set of package coordinates loaded from input.\n",

    "**Termination**: First, we observe that the algorithm terminates, as all loops eventually end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Case**: In the base case, we demonstrate that the algorithm is correct for a single test case. First, the algorithm reads _n_ from input, representing the number of packages. Then, it reads _n_ coordinates and stores them in a list, _coordinateList_, which will contain only one element, _nList_. This single element of _coordinateList_ is then sorted in ascending order using merge sort, primarily by the x-coordinate because \"Right\" is lexicographically smaller than \"Up.\" If two coordinates share the same xcoordinate, the y-coordinates are compared to determine the order.\n",
    "\n",

If reaching all packages is not possible, the algorithm prints \"NO.\" Otherwise, it prints \"YES\" followed by the lexicographically smallest path, specifically prioritizing the \"Right\" move over the \"Up\" move wherever applicable. Thus, the base case is correct.\n",

    "**Induction Step**: In the induction step, we assume the algorithm is correct for _t_ test cases, where _t > 1_, and prove that it is correct for _t + 1_ test cases. As in the base case, the set of coordinates for case _t + 1_ will be sorted in ascending order. The algorithm then checks whether there is an admissible path for collecting all packages. It prints \"NO\" if there is no admissible path, and \"YES\" followed by the lexicographically smallest path if one exists. By the induction hypothesis, the algorithm correctly prints the required outputs for _t_ cases. As we have shown, the algorithm also prints the correct output for the _t + 1_ case, following all _t_ casesâ€™ outputs. Therefore, the algorithm is correct for _t + 1_ cases.\n",

    "# Time Complexity Analysis of LexicographicallySmallestPath Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the `LexicographicallySmallestPath` algorithm depends on several parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorting each list of coordinates**:\n",
    "    - The `Sort` function employs a Merge Sort variant, which has a time complexity of $O(n \\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of coordinates in each test case.\n",
    "    - This sorting step dominates the algorithm's complexity because sorting each test case ensures that the path will be constructed in lexicographical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constructing the path**:\n",
    "    - For each coordinate, the algorithm calculates the distance from the current position to the target position. This process has a time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of coordinates in the test case.\n",
    "    - Appending moves to the `path` string also takes $O(n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Processing multiple test cases**:\n",
    "    - Let $t$ be the number of test cases and $n_i$ be the number of coordinates in the $i^{th}$ test case.\n",
    "    - For each test case, we perform the $O(n_i \\log n_i)$ sorting and $O(n_i)$ path construction.\n",
    "    - Summing over all test cases, the overall time complexity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "      $$\n",
    "      O\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^t (n_i \\log n_i + n_i)\\right) = O\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^t n_i \\log n_i\\right)\n",
    "      $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Complexity\n",
    "Thus, the time complexity of the `LexicographicallySmallestPath` algorithm is $O\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^t n_i \\log n_i\\right)$, which simplifies to $O(T \\cdot N \\log N)$ if each test case has approximately $N$ coordinates and there are $T$ test cases.<br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "From its analysis, I would say that its assessment is accurate. However, it differs slightly from my analysis because it omitted the analysis of the first for loop, which takes the number of packages and their positions. Even though I wouldn't consider its assessment incorrect, since both of our final results are the same, we both focused on breaking down the analysis of the most dominant part of the algorithm, and our results align. Additionally, it used more scientific expressions to describe the complexity."
